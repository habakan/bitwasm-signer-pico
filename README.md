> **bitwasm-signer** — Bitcoin, WebAssembly, signer; **pico** for the RP2350 it runs on.


[![CI](https://github.com/bitwasm-project/bitwasm-signer-pico/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bitwasm-project/bitwasm-signer-pico/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

`bitwasm-signer-pico` is the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 (RP2350) reference implementation for
[bitwasm-signer](https://github.com/bitwasm-project/bitwasm-signer). This repository contains the firmware, board-specific
UI and camera code, hardware documentation, and device integration checks. The reusable modules and
cross-platform examples live in bitwasm-signer.

![Firmware stack: Pico 2 hardware, native firmware, WAMR, and bitwasm-signer modules](docs/firmware-stack.svg)

The separate [PSBT browser viewer](https://github.com/bitwasm-project/bitwasm-signer/tree/main/examples/viewer) is maintained in bitwasm-signer.

The device runs `parser.wasm` from bitwasm-signer. Its `Parser hash` screen shows the module's SHA-256;
`make check-repro` rebuilds the pinned artifacts and compares them with the recorded hashes.

Japanese index at [docs/ja/README.md](docs/ja/README.md).

## Disclaimer

**This software has not been reviewed by a third party. Do not put real funds through it.**

It completes a signing round on signet. The measurements on this page come from this repository;
they do not show that anyone besides the author has tried to break it. Mainnet readiness, supported
transactions, and known limitations are listed in [docs/limitations.md](docs/limitations.md).

## Browser demo

Try the [live firmware demo](https://bitwasm-project.github.io/bitwasm-signer-pico/). It uses a test seed; never scan a real
SeedQR or use real funds. See [web/README.md](web/README.md) for the controls and implementation.

[![Browser demo showing the firmware menu, controls, and test-seed warning](docs/web-demo.png)](https://bitwasm-project.github.io/bitwasm-signer-pico/)

## The Pico 2 implementation

Read a seed from a SeedQR with the camera, receive a PSBT as an animated QR (UR), show it for review,
sign, and hand the signed PSBT back as a QR. The PC never holds a key or a recovery phrase — a
[signet transaction](https://mempool.space/signet/tx/de849e8c01a39fcf2aa84aaeeccb2ac8aea128086b2f4252539bcab90a0a432f)
went through that way ([verification procedure](docs/verification.md#signet-transaction)).

| Stage | Measured | |
|---|---|---|
| BIP39 seed (PBKDF2, 2048 rounds) | 0.47 s | native |
| PSBT parsing | 25 ms | **parser.wasm** (WAMR classic interpreter) |
| Checks and building the review screens | 147 ms | native |
| Signing (2 inputs, ECDSA + Schnorr) | 126 ms | native, cross-checked with embit |
| Animated QR output | 95 ms per part | reassembled byte-identical by `@ngraveio/bc-ur` |
| RAM | ~346KB of 520KB | the QR reader and the PSBT buffers share the heap |

Verified in this repository on RP2350 hardware, macOS hosts, and QEMU.

The firmware supports P2WPKH, P2TR key-path and P2WSH multisig of at most three keys (BIP48). BIP39
passphrase input is planned, but is not available yet.
PSBT v2 is not supported.

## Try it

### On hardware

Prebuilt firmware is on the [Releases](https://github.com/bitwasm-project/bitwasm-signer-pico/releases) page:
`bitwasm-signer-pico.uf2` for mainnet, `bitwasm-signer-pico-signet.uf2` for signet. Hold BOOTSEL while connecting
the Pico 2 over USB and copy the UF2 onto the drive. Building it yourself gives the same bytes
([docs/reproducible-build.md](docs/reproducible-build.md)).

Parts and wiring: [hardware](docs/hardware.md), [breadboard wiring](docs/breadboard.md). Japanese: [breadboard wiring](docs/ja/breadboard.md).

```sh
make deps-openocd                 # once, for SWD flashing (the Raspberry Pi fork of OpenOCD)
make run SECONDS=180              # flash, start listening, reset
make run TESTNET=1 SECONDS=180    # signet
```

Only a build with `TEST_SEED=1` can select the BIP39 test vector seed (the default is 0). Never put funds on it.
Known limitations and operational constraints are in [docs/limitations.md](docs/limitations.md).

### Build the browser demo

```sh
make web                          # signet build; needs Emscripten; writes signer.html and airgap-trial.html
make web TESTNET=0                # mainnet build
```

The same `main.c`, review screens, signing core and `parser.wasm` on WAMR, compiled to WebAssembly. The
signet `airgap-trial.html` simulates an AirGap transaction flow in the browser. It embeds the signer
and can create, review, sign, finalize and broadcast a one-input transaction to Signet. It uses the
public BIP39 test seed and is a demo, not a signing device: never use it for coins with value. For
the walkthrough, see
[the browser signet procedure](docs/verification.md#browser-demo-signet-transaction).

## Check it yourself

```sh
make check-repro   # rebuild parser.wasm with a pinned toolchain and compare against the record
```

The device's `Parser hash` screen should match the parser hash produced by this build
([docs/reproducible-build.md](docs/reproducible-build.md)).

```sh
make check-core        # signing core vectors (71 checks)
make check-xpub        # account xpub and descriptor (official BIP84 vectors)
make check-psbt        # a full PSBT round, UR round-trip, signatures verified with embit
make check-ui          # screen construction
make check-seedqr      # SeedQR reading, with ASan
make check-qemu-psbt   # the same round on RV32, output compared with the host
make check-camera-sim  # camera.pio against a Python simulator
make -C components/parts/parser test        # parser vectors (529 checks)
make -C components/parts/parser check-fuzz  # fuzzing the PSBT and UR parsers
```

Expected values come from independent implementations: embit, hashlib, `@ngraveio/bc-ur`, zxing-cpp,
Bitcoin Core. New tests are checked with mutation testing before they are trusted.

## What this repository contains
